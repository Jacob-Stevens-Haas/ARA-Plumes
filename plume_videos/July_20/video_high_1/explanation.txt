frame folders:
    blurred_path_frames: learned path on time_space_blur frames. NO mean smoothing
    fixed_avg_frames: background subtraction applied to frames from orig video
    frames: frames extracted from orig video
    learned_path_frames: learned path on subtracted frames (no kde applied)
    mean_smooth_frames_sig2: learned path on time_space_blur with gaussian blur applied to mean points

    space_blur: KDE applied to each image 
    time_space_blur: kde applied in time to the space_blue images
    -Files created from kde_smoothing.py in test_functions folder.
